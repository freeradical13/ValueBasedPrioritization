\section{Introduction}

Why should a particular goal be pursued (``Why")? Given a goal, what actions should be pursued to best accomplish said goal (``What")? Given an action, how should said action be pursued (``How")?

This article proposes that value theory usually best scopes ``Why" and ``What" and the scientific method usually best answers ``How". A method called Value-Based Prioritization is developed to answer the ``What" question:

\begin{equation}\label{article-equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    \textrm{Why: } \textit{Value Theory} \\
    \downarrow \\
    \textrm{What: } \textit{\textbf{Value-Based Prioritization}} \\
    \downarrow \\
    \textrm{How: } \textit{Scientific Method}
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\section{Why a Goal?}

``Why a Goal?" is usually best scoped using value systems because they are evaluative by nature\cite{value-theory}. Evaluating different value systems is left as an (lifelong) exercise for the reader\footnote{Example value systems include intuitionism\cite{huemer2007ethical}, consequentialism\cite{consequentialism}, evolutionary biology\cite{morality-biology}, religion\cite{religion-morality}, epicureanism\cite{epicurus}, stoicism\cite{stoicism}, political liberalism\cite{rawls}, anarcho-capitalism\cite{huemer2013problem}, communitarianism\cite{communitarianism}, objectivism\cite{ayn-rand}, etc.}.

\section{What Actions?}

``What Actions?" is usually best scoped by prioritizing actions because actions usually have differing effect sizes and time is limited. It follows from the value system used to answer ``Why" that the same value system is used primarily to evaluate the priority of each action.

This article proposes a method called Value-Based Prioritization which builds a quantitative prioritization model based on predicted effect sizes. Raw prioritization scores are further scaled by contextual factors such as implementation time, cost, risk, and other judgments.

\section{How to do an Action?}

Given answers to ``Why?" and ``What?", how to implement actions is usually best answered with the scientific method\cite{scientific-method}: observations are made and rational thought is used to generate hypotheses, hypotheses are tested with experiments, and successful experiments lead to theories and results.

\section{Value-Based Prioritization}

A \textbf{value system} \inlineequation[value-system]{V} generates a \textbf{goal} \inlineequation[goal]{G(t)} (for some future time $t$) and a set of \textbf{mutually exclusive potential future actions} $A(t)$:

\begin{equation}\label{potential-actions}
  \begin{gathered}
A(t) = \{A_1(t), \ldots, A_N(t)\}, \\
N > 1
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

An action's \textbf{estimated relative accomplishment amount} $B(A(t))$ is an action's expected \textit{relative} (i.e. with respect to other actions) contribution towards accomplishing $G$(t):

\begin{equation}\label{action-amount}
  \begin{gathered}
B(A(t)) = \mathbb{R}, \\
0 \leq \mathbb{R} \leq 1
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

Thus, $G(t)$ is fully accomplished if all actions are accomplished:

\begin{equation}\label{goal-accomplished}
G(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} B(A_i(t)) = 1
\end{equation}

A \textbf{value-based prioritization score} $C(A(t))$ is the result of the product of a set of \textbf{value-based prioritization scale functions} \inlineequation[scale-functions]{S = \{S_1, \ldots, S_N\}} multiplied by \eqref{action-amount}:

\begin{equation}\label{prioritization-score}
  \begin{gathered}
C(A(t)) = B(A(t)) \cdot \prod_{j=1}^{N} S_j(A(t)), \\
0 \leq S_j(B(A(t))) \leq 1
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

Example scale functions include implementation time, cost, risk, and other judgments. Ideally, scale functions should be defined before running the model to reduce bias. The set $S$ always includes the element $S_1(A(t)) = 1$. Note that $\sum_{i=1}^{N} C(A_i(t)) \neq G$ if any $S_j(A_i(t)) < 1$.

A \textbf{value-based prioritization} $Z(t)$ is a sequence of actions ordered by prioritization score \eqref{prioritization-score} in descending order:

\begin{equation}\label{vbp}
  \begin{gathered}
Z(t) = (A_1(t), \ldots, A_N(t)), \\
C(A_1(t)) \geq \ldots \geq C(A_N(t))
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

The first $k$ actions in $Z(t)$ should be executed in descending priority/proportion where \inlineequation[how-many-actions]{k} is chosen based on factors such as available concurrency, time, resources, etc.

\section{Modeled Value-Based Prioritization}

Historical data may be used to predict actions' estimated relative accomplishment amounts \eqref{action-amount} at a future time \inlineequation[modeled-future-time]{t_F}  (e.g. the average time actions will take to ramp up implementation).

If each action has historical data $D(A)$:

\begin{equation}\label{action-predictors}
\begin{multlined}
D(A) = \\
\shoveleft[0.5cm]{((t_1, D(A,t_1)), \ldots, (t_N, D(A,t_N)))}
\end{multlined}
\end{equation}

Then, a set of \textbf{comparable prediction models} $R(D(A))$ is applied to each $D(A)$ (e.g. linear regression with different degrees):

\begin{equation}\label{prediction-models}
\begin{multlined}
R(D(A)) =\\
\{R_1(D(A)), \ldots, R_N(D(A))\}
\end{multlined}
\end{equation}

The models are compared using \textbf{model selection}\cite{wit2012all,zucchini2000introduction} \inlineequation[model-selection]{L(R(D(A)))} (e.g. adjusted $r^2$, AIC, ANOVA, cross-validation, etc.).

For each action, the \textbf{best fitting model} $M(A(t))$ is selected from $R(D(A))$ using $L(R(D(A)))$.

Each action's $M(A(t_F))$ is used to predict $B(A(t_F))$.

Finally, \textbf{modeled value-based prioritization} \inlineequation[modeled-vbp]{Z(t_F)} is simply \eqref{vbp} with $t_F$.

\section{Choosing Meaningful Work}

The following example applies modeled value-based prioritization \eqref{modeled-vbp} to the goal of choosing meaningful work. Every aspect is an example and should be reconsidered.

First, outline the parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\item \eqref{value-system} $V = $ a value system which answers ``Why work?" with ``To reduce suffering" which is defined as maximal human suffering: death\footnote{More accurately, something like the lack of a potential of life.}. Alternatives include disease burden (e.g. Quality-Adjusted Life Years [QALYs/DALYs]\cite{weinstein2009qalys}), non-human suffering, pre-birth suffering, etc.
\item \eqref{goal} $G(t) = $ eliminate human death.
\item \eqref{potential-actions} $A(t) = $ the set of actions which would eliminate human death.
\item \eqref{how-many-actions} $k = $ 2 for a single person, weighted heavily on the first item with the second item being a hedge or volunteer activity.
\item \eqref{modeled-future-time} $t_F = $ 5 years; an average amount of time under normal conditions to integrate into a new career to work on some subset of $A(t)$ (including learning, certification, building experience, networking, etc.).
\item \eqref{action-predictors} $D(A) = $ time-series data on human death by underlying cause.
\item \eqref{prediction-models} $R(D(A)) = $ linear regression with one, two, and three degrees.
\item \eqref{model-selection} $L(R(D(A))) = $ adjusted $r^2$.
\end{itemize}

$A(t)$ is the set of 176 actions which would eliminate the 176 major groups (ICD-10 sub-chapters\cite{icd10}) of underlying causes of death in the United States\cite{centers2017underlying}\textsuperscript{,}\footnote{Group Results By ``Year" And By ``ICD Sub-Chapter"; Check ``Export Results"; Uncheck ``Show Totals"}:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{gathered}
A(t) = \{\\
A_1(t) = \textrm{Eliminate: Malignant neoplasms},\\
A_2(t) = \textrm{Eliminate: Ischaemic heart diseases},\\
\textrm{\ldots}\\
A_{176}(t) = \textrm{Eliminate: Other disorders of ear}\\
\}
\end{gathered}
\end{equation*}

Review the list of actions and hypothesize scale functions. Examples:

\begin{itemize}
\item $S_1(A_i) = 1$: Required scale function.
\item $S_2(A_i)$: Likelihood of Success. If primarily political then 0.1, else 1.
\item $S_3(A_i) = \left(1 - \frac{AverageAge(A_i)}{MaxAge(A(t))}\right)$
                \newline\newline
                Scale towards younger people as they have more to lose.
\item $S_4(A_i) = \begin{cases}\text{0} & \mbox{if } L(R(D(A_i))) < 0.1 \\ \text{1} & \mbox{if } L(R(D(A_i))) \ge 0.1 \\ \end{cases}$
                \newline\newline
                Remove actions with poorly predicted $B(A_i(t_F))$.
\item $S_5(A_i) = \left(\frac{(f(A_i)-min(f(A(t)))) \cdot (b-a)}{max(f(A(t))-min(f(A(t))}\right) + a$
                \newline\newline
                $f(A) = M'(A(t_F)), a=0.5, b=1$
                \newline\newline
                Scale down by up to half by the relative rate of change of an action's predicted rate of death: Take the derivative of $M(A)$ and evaluate it with the predicted value and min-max normalize\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(statistics)}} into $[0.5,1]$.
\end{itemize}

The list does not include common scale functions such as implementation time, cost, risk, playing into strengths, piquing interest, market demand, return on investment, ramp-up time, interest, etc. because all medical actions are predicted to be in the same order of magnitude for those scales and all other actions are primarily political so they have a low score, rendering those scales moot.

Create a table listing all actions as rows and all manually calculated scale functions as columns, and fill any non-$1$ values. For example:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\toprule
Action & $S_1$  & \ldots & $S_N$  \\
\midrule
$A_1$  & 0.1    &        &        \\
$A_2$  &        &        & 0.25   \\
\ldots &        &        &        \\
$A_N$  & 0.99   &        & 0.9    \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Example scale function table}
\label{table:scaletable}
\end{table}

$D(A)$ for each action is the time-series data of number of deaths per year. For example, for $A_1(t)$:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\toprule
Year    & Deaths \\
\midrule
1999    & 549838 \\
\ldots  & \ldots \\
2017    & 599108 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Deaths per year for $A_1(t)$}
\label{table:daa1}
\end{table}
