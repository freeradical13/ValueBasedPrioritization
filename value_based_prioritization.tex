\author{Kevin Grigorenko\cite{Author1}}

\newcommand{\abstractText}{\noindent
A method is proposed to use value theory to quantitatively prioritize
potential actions to accomplish a goal. This method is applied to the
example of choosing meaningful work using an example value system based
in the desire to reduce suffering.

\section{Introduction}

Why should a particular goal be pursued (``Why")? Given a goal, what actions should be pursued to best accomplish said goal (``What")? Given an action, how should said action be pursued (``How")?

This article proposes that value theory usually best scopes ``Why" and ``What" and the scientific method usually best answers ``How". A method called Value-Based Prioritization \eqref{article-equation} is developed to answer the ``What" question:

\begin{equation}\label{article-equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    \textrm{Why: } \textit{Value Theory} \\
    \downarrow \\
    \textrm{What: } \textit{\textbf{Value-Based Prioritization}} \\
    \downarrow \\
    \textrm{How: } \textit{Scientific Method}
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\section{Why a Goal?}

``Why a Goal?" is usually best scoped using a value system because value systems are evaluative by nature\cite{value-theory}. Example value systems include intuitionism\cite{huemer2007ethical}, consequentialism\cite{consequentialism}, evolutionary biology\cite{morality-biology}, religion\cite{religion-morality}, epicureanism\cite{epicurus}, stoicism\cite{stoicism}, political liberalism\cite{rawls}, communitarianism\cite{communitarianism}, objectivism\cite{ayn-rand}, etc. Evaluating different value systems is left as an (lifelong) exercise for the reader.

\section{What Actions?}

``What Actions?" is usually best scoped by prioritizing actions because actions usually have differing effect sizes. It follows from the value system used to answer ``Why" that the same value system is used to evaluate the priority of each action. This article proposes a method called Value-Based Prioritization which builds a quantitative prioritization model based on predicted effect sizes. Raw prioritization scores are further refined by contextual factors such as implementation time, cost, risk, and other judgments.

\section{How to do an Action?}

Given answers to ``Why?" and ``What?", how to implement actions is usually best answered with the scientific method\cite{scientific-method}: observations are made and rational thought is used to generate hypotheses, hypotheses are tested with experiments, and successful experiments lead to theories and results.
